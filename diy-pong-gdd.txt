Game description

Pong is a two-dimensional sports game that simulates table tennis. The player controls an in-game paddle by moving it vertically across the left or right side of the screen. They can compete against another player controlling a second paddle on the opposing side. Players use the paddles to hit a ball back and forth. The goal is for each player to reach eleven points before the opponent; points are earned when one fails to return the ball to the other.

To-Do-List

1. Create the objects (2 paddles and a ball)
2. Setup a playground (background, walls )
2. Make paddles move independently (w and s for player 1, up arrow and down arrow for player 2)
3. Restrict the movement of the paddles according to the screen size
4. Make the ball move from left to right
5. Add physics to paddles and ball
6. Make ball bounce off paddles and walls

Future-To-Do-List

1. Add score board
2. Add main menu, options menu
3. Add music, sfx
4. Create assets in MagicaVoxel
5. Add particle effects
6. Implement narrow AI (player vs CPU)
7. Add win screen, game over screen
